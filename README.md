## Projects

### ThorJS

I 'hacked' myself into Google's [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) project, the technology behind most web browsers used today, and I changed the code to speed up how fast websites load, achieving 27% speedup in some cases. Diving into this huge project by myself felt like climbing a mountain, but with patience and hard work, I got there and achieved a great result.
